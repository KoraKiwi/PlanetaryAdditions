# More ways to destroy nature, yay!
A simple mindustry mod which adds new content, mostly factories along with things for distribution, pumping and storing liquids and items, and things for power.
Don't expect much, i made this because i wanted new factories, also this is a "test" mod for me to see how things work before i make my main mod.
# This mod adds...
  More important stuff on Serpulo:
Graphite Batch Press = A more efficient model from the Graphite Press family, has a 1:1 conversion ratio. Crafting time is longer than the Multi-Press, but shorter than the Graphite Press
Silicon Crystallization Chamber = Deletes your silicon problems, but creates a coal and sand problem. Uses sand and graphite idiotic amounts of power to produce ridicolous amount of silicon.
Scorch Kiln = Portable conduit maker. Has a 1:1 lead-sand to metaglass ratio and smelts 4 times faster, but requires pyratite to produce the heat required.
Plastanium Refiner = Produces plastanium 8 times faster, but requires additional blast compound to compress it.
Quantum Weaver = (not yet implemented)Weaves phase fabric x times faster than the standard model, but requires additional stabilizer in the form of cryofluid.
Alloy Crucible = Creates more surge alloy than the normal surge smelter, but requires additional thorium.
Cryo-Blender = Produces cryofluid, but faster, and slightly more efficiently.
Pyratite Blender = Mixes larger amounts of sand, coal and lead into more pyratite.
Blast Blender = Mixes larger amounts of pyratite and spores into more blast compound.
Nanosteel Forge = Produces nanosteel from silicon, surge alloy and plastanium.
Omnidrill = Ever played v3? This is pretty much it. It can drill every ore, and does it with maximum efficiency, which can be boosted with water.
Fission Reactor = Larger and more efficient thorium reactor.
Surge Nodes = Power Nodes but with extra range, connections, and a small, inbuilt battery.
Surge Panels = More efficient solar panels which produce more power than their less advanced counterparts. Their only downside is that they require surge alloy to build.
Power Cell = A heavy duty power storage device, better not let it be destroyed when it's fully charged. :/
Siloes = Store very large amounts of items or liquids.
  More important stuff on Erekir:
Silicon Surge Oven = A bigger and faster Arc Oven. Doesn't actually craft faster, but produces 3 times more.
Advanced Oxidation Chamber = (not yet implemented) A more efficient Oxidation Chamber which produces more heat and oxide.
Convection Heater = More efficient electric heater, occupies 3x3 tiles and produces roughly 1 heat/30 power units.
Carbon Infuser = Produces carbide more efficiently.
Surge Charger = More efficient version of the Surge Crucible.
Quantum Synthetizer = Synthetizes more phase fabric at the cost of additional ozone.
Nanite Crucible = Produces nanosteel from silicon, carbide and beryllium.
Beryllium Capacitors = Stores more power than beam nodes, but are more costly and fragile.
Surge Beam Nodes = Beam Nodes with longer range, health and slightly more power storage.
Beryllium Solar Panels = Erekir is very close to the sun, why not cover it in solar farms? Produce some energy from the sun, but are quite costly.
Centrifugal Pump = A more cost efficient liquid pump.
Reinforced Siloes = Store very large amounts of items or liquids. Item siloes don't connect to the core.
  Other Important Stuff
Nanosteel = An "alloy" composed of impact resistant nanobots. They harden in response to physical trauma, you can't hurt them!(Disclaimer: You can.)
Nanosteel Walls = The ultimate wall. Has high armor, health, reflects bullets, blocks piercing bullets and lasers, creates arcs, and has an inbuilt shield projector.
Testing Facility = (may be implemented)A Malis testing facility for testing new technologies. Capturing will probably unlock more important erekir buildings.
